# An HTTP GET request sends a message from the client/browser to the server with all the information contained in the URL of the message. So URL Parameters and I believe cookies can be received by the server from a GET request. A POST request actually stores data in the body of the client message that is received by the server. It seems like GET is recommended when the result is more of a database query, rather than any data manipulation.
